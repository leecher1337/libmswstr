This is libmswstr version 0.0.1

When using Microsoft Jet 4 Databases, index fields are created using the 
DBLCMapStringW function (check MSDN library for documentation of this function).
Jet 4 driver itself loads this function from mswstr.dll on Microsoft Windows.
The library contains static translation tables (as opposed to LCMapStringW API)
in order to have consistent translations across all Windows Versions.

Libraries that try to read and parse mdb file indices like mdbtools should work
on every platform and therefore a platform independent version of this library
is needed. This is an attempt to port the library to Posix-systems.

Requirements:
=============

First, you must have installations of:
	libtool
	automake
	autoconf
If you don't you should install them first. Sources are available at
ftp.gnu.org.

Installation from source:
=========================

Lastest version is available at https://github.com/leecher1337/libmswstr

  $ libtoolize
  $ aclocal
  $ automake -a 
  $ autoconf

The configure and finally make it:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

You can then run 'make install' as root to install (to /usr/local by default).
Some systems will also need the ld cache to be updated after installation;
You can do that running 'ldconfig' as root.

Contacts
========

Please send bug repports to the github platform.
