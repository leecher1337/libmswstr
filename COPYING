I had to reverse engineer the mswstr.dll in order to get the translation 
tables. Unless someone uses the information gathered by reading this library
to write a proper library with a proper license.
So I guess I can't claim copyright for this code.
Therefore regarding license I can just say: Take it or leave it.
